figure out bit error rate and transmission speed
J write detailed report describing the modulation scheme 
J if we change pulses a little we could make them a lot thinner
	- we need to be under the USB frequency
	- cut off empty space on sincs, just use the middle part
	- make pulses such that they are 32,000 samples long or shorter
	- generate a few (32k and half of that) so that we can check since the shorter they are the worse of a time we will have correlating
M demodulation/decoding
after we get transmission, run it and tune it, because we're really slow so it needs to be good

11-12:30

first get the envelope then threshholds for rising edge
check if its low and then becomes high
